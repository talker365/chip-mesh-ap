           ToDo / Idea's    
====================================
 

Goals:
1) Edit Installation / Routine Scripts:
	Handle AP / MESH processes in the mmconfig scripting.

* In process

2) Add ethernet port functions for both router and mesh uses.

3) Completion of Installation Webpages & test.
	Upon completing the Webpages for Router and Mesh, we can try to wrap up both modes.

* In process

4) GPIO
      - Monitor & Control GPOI (Inputs / Outputs)
      - Add digital sensors (I2C)
      - LCD Support
      - GPS Support
      - Software Controller FEL pin activation / reboot / Auto-Flash.

5) Upon completion of Installation, re-direct to a Status Page.
	From here we can determine what pages, format, etc is needed for Router / Mesh types.

	Page Idea's: 
		- Status: # of Connected Nodes on AP / Router 

		(created batmon script) 
			- Status: If Battery is Equipped	
			- Power Status: (Mains / Emg Backup ie.. battery usage)
			- Battery Voltage
			- Battery Current Status ( ".425 ma" Positive amperage charging / "-600.ma" discharging)
		
		- Status: Typical Router / Mesh Info
			- IP Address, 
			- Netmask,
			- Gateway etc...

		- Admin: Typical Network & Password Changes.
			VTUNNEL Setup
